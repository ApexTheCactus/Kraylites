# Kraylites Masterdoc
This document is intended to establish lore and worldbuilding elements for the Kraylites, a faction I am currently working on creating for the game Endless Sky.
## Intro
The Kraylites are an enigmatic species that seemingly redefine the definition of "life". They are silicon-based lifeforms, incorporating complex and poorly-understood processes into their makeup that, by definition, would be inaccurately referred to as their "biology." Even with this lack of understanding, there is still a vast amount of information relating to their culture and species. Kraylites hail from their homeworld of Krayl, a volcanic world rich in minerals and teeming with energy that seemingly catalyzed their formation. 
## Biology
Kraylites appear as pale floating icosahedral crystals of varying sizes upwards of 0.5 meters in diameter, with most averaging 1.5-2 meters in diameter. There is no identified upper limit to their growth, with the most ancient Kraylites in some cases exceeding diameters of 100 meters, though these particular beings are rarely seen. Their primary form of locomotion and interaction with their environment is through self-generated magnetic fields, allowing them to float above the ground and extend bits of themselves in the form of magnetic nanoparticles to manipulate their environment. They have two primary forms of energy generation to fuel their existence: smaller Kraylites rely on radiosynthesis for energy, while larger beings utilize a form of piezoelectric energy generation after growing to sufficient size. Their primary method of nutrient intake is through "seeding," a process remarkably similar to tree growth in which the individual Kraylite plants itself within the ground, branching crystal "roots" under the soil to leech nutrients from the surrounding area, and growing "branches" above ground to facilitate radiosynthesis.
