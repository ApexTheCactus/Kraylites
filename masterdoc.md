# Kraylites Masterdoc
This document is intended to establish lore and worldbuilding elements for the Kraylites, a faction I am currently working on creating for the game Endless Sky.
## Intro
The Kraylites are an enigmatic species that seemingly redefine the definition of "life". They are silicon-based lifeforms, incorporating complex and poorly-understood processes into their makeup that, by definition, would be inaccurately referred to as their "biology." Even with this lack of understanding, there is still a vast amount of information relating to their culture and species.
Kraylites hail from their homeworld of Krayl, a highly volcanic world close to it's host star, rich in minerals and teeming with energy that seemingly catalyzed their formation. Their homeworld possesses a relatively strong magnetic field for a planet of it's size, with a thin atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen and sulfur, with trace amounts of fluorine, chlorine, and argon.
## Composition & Biology
Kraylites appear as pale, floating crystals of varying sizes upwards of 0.5 meters in diameter, with most averaging 1.5-2 meters in diameter. There is no identified upper limit to their growth, with the most ancient Kraylites in some cases exceeding diameters of 100 meters, though these particular beings are rarely seen. 
A Kraylite's age can be assumed in relation to not only it's size, but in it's form as well. As a Kraylite ages, it grows crystalline "branches" that increase in complexity. The youngest Kraylites appear as little more than a smooth icosahedron, while the oldest among them possess a highly complex, intricate latticework resembling a repeating fractal pattern.
Young Kraylites having a remarkably smooth exterior to the touch, while older Kraylites feel increasingly rough and jagged as a consequence of their growth.

Their primary form of locomotion and interaction with their environment is through self-generated magnetic fields, allowing them to float above the ground and extend bits of themselves in the form of magnetized nanoparticles to manipulate their environment. 

They have two primary forms of energy generation to fuel their existence: smaller Kraylites rely on radiosynthesis for energy, while larger beings utilize a form of piezoelectric energy generation after growing to sufficient size to sustain it. 

Their primary method of nutrient intake is through "rooting," a process remarkably similar to tree growth in which the individual Kraylite plants itself within the ground, branching crystalline roots under the soil to leech nutrients from the surrounding area, and growing "branches" above ground to facilitate radiosynthesis. A Kraylite in the process of rooting undergoes a state of hibernation, often remaining rooted for years, in some cases growing for centuries. 
This causes the formation of Kraylite "groves" in which large amounts of Kraylites gather in a particularly nutrient-rich area to root for many years at a time, creating something akin to a crystal forest.
A Kraylite in the process of rooting is continually replicating it's crystal structure on a microscopic scale, mimicking cell growth in carbon-based organisms, and increasing the complexity of it's branching patterns. No two Kraylites have a perfectly identical branch pattern, and the pattern it generates seems to dictate the formation and manifestation of it's personality and behavior to some degree.

Kraylites primarily reproduce asexually, scattering pieces of themselves into the ground as "seeds" that root and sprout into new Kraylites after many years. They are also capable of a form of reproductive synthesis in which two or more Kraylites with sufficiently different patterns may join together to produce an entirely new pattern-seed taking features from all parents involved.
